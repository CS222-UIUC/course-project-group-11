      As students, many may find it difficult to connect and interact with other students for academic purposes,
      whether it is physicalliy or digitally. With the enormous amounts of Discord Channels and groups, it can seem a daunting task 
      to ask for help. So, as part of our CS222: Group Project we decided to solve this problem. “ClassKonnect” provides a method for students to connect with one another based on shared courses, 
      allowing for more expedient and effective collaboration.
