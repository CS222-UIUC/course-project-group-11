Logging out of our web app

### Legacy statements

# Update on Nov 18

This week, I implemented the query that returns the top 5 most similar users to a given user depending on the courses the user is taking this semester. This way, when a user is logged in, the main page can display such similar students. I also removed the button that says "Your Friends" in most of the webpages as we no longer implement the functionality.

# Update on Nov 11
I successfully implemented the multi-class search functionality which now handles up to 4 multiple class search. Also, I fixed a minor bug which stopped us from looking for some course information. This was due to the fact that during the migration of the data from the CSV to our DB on AWS, whitespaces and other punctuations were not handled properly for some courses. Thus, I added a piece of code in `app.py` to deal with this seemingly minor issue.

Screenshots for the search page with two classes selected and for the result page:

# Update on Nov 4
I populated 10 additional users with valid enrollments to the database so that we have more understanding on how this web app works. Also, I have implemented the multi-class search functionality although this is not still perfect in that the program cannot handle more than 3 multiple class seraches. Next week, I will focus on finalizing this functionality.

# Update on Oct 28
I implemented the functionality to display courses and users info when you click on a button associated with either of them, fetching data from the SQL database (see screenshots below)

When you click on a course button [ CS 222 SL1 ]
<img src="/static/img/course1.png" alt="users" style="height: 250px; width:2276px;"/>

When you click on a course button [ STAT 400 YL1 ]
<img src="/static/img/course2.png" alt="users" style="height: 250px; width:2276px;"/>

When you click on a user button [ guest ]
<img src="/static/img/user1.png" alt="users" style="height: 250px; width:2276px;"/>

When you click on a user button [ inst ]
<img src="/static/img/user2.png" alt="users" style="height: 250px; width:2276px;"/>

Also, I successfully implemented the user registration system although it was not assigned to me because this task, I am sure, is tough. Screenshots below are the registration pages (what users should put in the webpage to populate our DB with the user input). Basically, users should provide either (1) CRN or (2) a combination of a course name and a section name.

To register info on 'guest2'
<img src="/static/img/guest2.png" alt="users" style="height: 250px; width:2276px;"/>

To register info on 'guest3'
<img src="/static/img/guest3.png" alt="users" style="height: 250px; width:2276px;"/>

After populating the users and enrollments tables by registering users, now those tables look like the following:

Users

Enrollments

# Update on Oct 21
I decided to make my SQL server on AWS available to anyone who has access to this PR/repo so serious security concerns aside, we can all access the same DB on AWS at least in `app.py`.

# You can explore SQL queries to interact with the server but NEVER RUN A QUERY WHICH CONTAINS THE WORD 'DELETE' OR 'UPDATE'

I also implemented a UI for class search feature from which you can look up users who are taking a course or a combination of courses from the courses you are taking. To do so, once you log in (refer to the users table shown below), you will see a button 'Class Search' so you cannot miss it.

Class Search

## Oct 7 or 14
I managed to extract info on every section of every course offered at UIUC in Fall 2022 from Course Explorer API. Refer to `course_extractor.ipynb`. If you run each cell in the jupyter notebook, you will obtain `fall2022_courses.csv` which is exactly what we need. Now that it is just a few steps away from setting up a database, I guess each of us can set it up locally. I consider setting it up on AWS so that we all can interact with the DB.

## Requirements
Refer to the `requirements.txt` file.

## Test Coverage
We are still having difficulty in using pytest for testing a flask web app, but here's the result of running the following command: `pytest --cov --cov-branch -v test.py`
