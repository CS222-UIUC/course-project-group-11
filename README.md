Hey this is the way, I came up with to read a JSON file I made. To run this, I used the react framework, as it has a fetch feature to read data. To install react you might have to run these commansds in your terminal:


npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start


After this you would be able to see a new react app. I would not recomment cloning my repo as it is missing some of the react files that the PR couuldn't install.

Instead, I would just recommend seeing/ copying 2 main folders "./data/records.json" and "App.js"

When you run the app, it looks like this
